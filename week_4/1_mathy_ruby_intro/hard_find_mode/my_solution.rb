# Complete each step below according to the challenge directions and 
# include it in this file. Also make sure everything that isn't code
# is commented in the file.  

# I worked on this challenge [by myself].

# 1. Pseudocode
# Make mode a method
# mode should take a single arguement
# What is the input?
# What is the output? (i.e. What should the code return?)
# What are the steps needed to solve the problem?


# 2. Initial Solution

def mode (arg)
