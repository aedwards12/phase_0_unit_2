# U2.W5: Virus Predictor

# I worked on this challenge [by myself, with: ].

# EXPLANATION OF require_relative
#
#
require_relative 'state_data' # needs local file state_data in order to execute
# state_data is a hash that contains 50 states. Inside each state key contains a nested hash of key values pairs.

# Reflection

=begin
I worked with Michelle on this challenge. She was great because she was easy to work with and had good knowledge
on how ruby private instances and methods worked. We worked well together and completed this challenge in an hour.
We did not have to look online for any content in this challenge we pretty much knew how to do everything we wanted 
  to do. I feel confident in the competencies of this challenge. I did not think anything was tedious.
