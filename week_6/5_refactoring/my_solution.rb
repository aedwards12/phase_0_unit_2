# U2.W6: Refactoring for Code Readability


# I worked on this challenge [ with: ].
# Francisco Scala
#Anthony Edwards Jr

# Original Solution
# forked from S-Loar on github

# PSEUDOCODE

# Input would be a 16 digit credit card number
# Output would be true or false
# Initialize class CreditCard
# Write a method that checks card based on Luhn algorithm which follows these steps:
# 1) Starting with the second to last digit, double every other digit until you reach the first digit
# 2) Sum all the untouched digits and the doubled digits (doubled digits need to be broken apart, 10 becomes 1 + 0)
# 3) If the total is a multiple of ten, you have received a valid credit card number!

class CreditCard # Creating class credit card

  def initialize(card_number) # defining a method called initialize that takes a card number as an arguement
  	if card_number.to_s.length != 16 then
  	  raise ArgumentError.new("The credit card number must have 16 digits.")# if card number length is not 16 digits exactly rais an arguement error
  	end
  	@card_number = card_number # initialize a variable instance of Credit card
  end 

  def check_card # defining a method called check_card with 2 variables sum , digit_count both equal to zero
  	sum = 0
  	digit_count = 0
  	numbers = @card_number.to_s.reverse # changes @card_number to a string and reverse the order
  	
  	numbers.each_char { |digit| # iterate though each char of string numbers 
  	  digit = digit.to_i  	# each char with be turned into and int
  	  
  	  if digit_count.odd? # check if digit_count is odd, if it is multiply it by 2
  	  	digit *= 2
  	  end

  	  if digit >= 10  # if digit is great or equal to 10 then digit will be equal to digit - 10  + 1 
  	  	digit = (digit - 10) + 1
  	  end 

  	  sum += digit # adding the new value of digit to sum
  	  digit_count += 1  # add 1 to digit_count with each iteration. 
  	   
  	} # closed the each_char block

  	(sum % 10).zero?  # asks if result of numbers.each_char stored in sum % ten is equal to zero

  end
  
end


# Refactored Solution
# This code looks very neat, clean and easy to read. We don't see ways to make this better since there is no repetition
# 


# DRIVER TESTS GO BELOW THIS LINE
def assert
  raise "Assertion failed!" unless yield
end

card = CreditCard.new(4408041234567893)

assert{ card.check_card == true }

assert{
		card2 = CreditCard.new(4408041234567893)
		card2.check_card == true
			}

I worked with Francisco on this challenge. He is alittle behind but he knowlegde was still
helpful in this challenge. We used Steven Loars code to analyze. It was really interesting to see
how he completed this challenge. Compared to mine he completed his in way less steps using different methods
I feel confident in the learning competences of this challenge. We did not need to look up anything online 
to help complete this task.
